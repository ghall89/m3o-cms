## About

A simple experimental CLI app built with Node.js, and powered by [m3o.com](https://m3o.com).

The goal of the project is to create a tool to manage my portfolio at [ghall.dev](https://ghall.dev) more easily without having to modify and redeploy my entire site every time.

I don't actually recommend running this code, it's just a VERY quick and dirty prototype at this stage, and as such has many issues, such as:

- No error checking
- No input validation
- No type of authentication outside of an API key (which you must provide yourself)
